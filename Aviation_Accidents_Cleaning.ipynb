    "# Aviation Accidents Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of a consulting firm that is tasked to do an analysis of commercial and passenger jet airline safety. The client (an airline/airplane insurer) is interested in knowing what types of aircraft (makes/models) exhibit low rates of total destruction and low likelihood of fatal or serious passenger injuries in the event of an accident. They are also interested in any general variables/conditions that might be at play. Your analysis will be based off of aviation accident data accumulated from the years 1948-2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our client is only interested in airplane makes/models that are professional builds and could potentially still be active. Assume a max lifetime of 40 years for a make/model retirement and make sure to filter your data accordingly (i.e. from 1983 onwards). They would also like separate recommendations for small aircraft vs. larger passenger models. **In addition, make sure that claims that you make are statistically robust and that you have enough samples when making comparisons between groups.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this summative assessment you will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "- **Use Pandas to load, inspect, and clean the dataset appropriately.**\n",
    "- **Transform relevant columns to create measures that address the problem at hand.**\n",
    "- conduct EDA: visualization and statistical measures to systematically understand the structure of the data\n",
    "- recommend a set of airplanes and makes conforming to the client's request and identify at least *two* factors contributing to airplane safety. You must provide supporting evidence (visuals, summary statistics, tables) for each claim you make."
